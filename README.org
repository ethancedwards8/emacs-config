#+TITLE: Ethan Edward's Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Ethan Carter Edwards
#+OPTIONS: toc:t
#+PROPERTY: header-args:emacs-lisp :tangle ./test.el :mkdirp yes

This setup was highly inspired by [[https://jamiecollinson.com/blog/my-emacs-config/#footnote-1][Jamie Collinson's config]]

This is my Emacs Configuration, I've been using Emacs for a few months and I decided to go big or go home.

After a while of having it all in a single elisp file it got annoying/hard to work with.

I'm documenting it for fun, and I like notes so I'm linking to where I found each trick or configuration.

I'll also probably put this somewhere on [[https://ethancedwards.com][my site]] and update it from time to time, but the "live" version is on my [[https://gitlab.com/ethancedwards/emacs-config][gitlab]].
